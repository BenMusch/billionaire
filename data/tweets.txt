Overwork. Underspend.
Our ego keeps us from seeing the mistakes we are making. There is no success in arrogance.
When nature gives you burning desire, it also gives you the means to satisfy them. All you have to do is dedicate your life to learning and doing and never quitting.

One of the most satisfying experiences in life is doing something when no one thought it was in you.

Take care of your pennies and your dollars will take care of themselves.
Most important thing money gives you: freedom.

Length of blood vessels in your body laid end to end are long enough to go 2.5 times around the earth. All the DNA in your body if placed end to end would stretch ten billion miles. Don’t take precious life for granted. You are here for a purpose. Get on it. And stay on it.
When you are convinced life sucks, when you can’t stop complaining about how miserable your life is, try to help those who're worse off than you. Go visit a homeless shelter. Go to a hospital to see kids diagnosed with cancer. It will help you get out of your despair.
What you get depends on what you aim for. If you aren’t aiming, you aren’t getting.
Stop pretending that you are anything other than what you are. That’s what sets you free. That’s what allows you to put all your energy and focus and time on whatever you are trying to achieve.

Books are your most important friend.
You are unique. Original. Your experiences in life equally unique, original. No one can share your unique experiences. That’s why no one can tell you where is the end of the tunnel you have dug yourself in. Only person who can take you up is you.
Success is not about being a winner. Because for a winner, there must be a loser. Great success happens when you create something different, when you focus on what people want and not what you want to push.
Each experience in your life is a lesson. Each person you meet your teacher. Stay humble. Stay learning. Stay striving. Stay succeeding.
We know the value of people and things only after they are gone. Appreciate people you have while you have them. Now.
Surround yourself with people who support you. Hang out with people who inspire you.
Nobody can give you wisdom. All those painful experiences of your life, those doors that slam on your face, all those moments of discomfort, of frustration, of stress, of tension, that’s what gives you wisdom.

If you are not happy with what you have, you are not going to be happy with all that you get. Focus on doing, not on toys.
You know you are lucky when you have something or someone that makes saying goodbye so hard.
To succeed, be you. You can’t be yourself if you don’t know who you are. Don’t ask someone else to tell you who you are, what your purpose is, why you are here. If you want to succeed, this is something you have to figure out for yourself. Only way to figure it out: by doing.
